I am currently in my first year at IIIT-H learning computer science and pursuing a degree in B.Tech + MS in CSE. I love all things tech, coding, sketching, designing and painting. I am from Kerala and currently study at Hyderabad. I am very much interested in learning new stuff and constantly trying to improve my skills.  
I love all things technology and I am currently trying to  pick up new skills in college. On the process of this I came across KDE and started contributing to the web team and I am currently taking part in KDE SoK Program. I started with web development for a start and now I am planning to branch out to other projects.
